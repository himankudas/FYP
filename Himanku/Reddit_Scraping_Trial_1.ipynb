Regarding flirtation, try your best to remind yourself that flirting doesn't mean someone wants to marry you and have kids with you a few years down the line. Flirting can just happen in the moment, it's like playing a game with a friend. It's fun. It doesn't have any major expectations, it *could* lead to something, or maybe it won't. You're a good person, I can tell. Regardless of where it leads, you'll still be that same good person.

We crave emotional and physical intimacy from others, but we’re just so conditioned to not having it.\n",
            "It's more got to do with expectations and self-esteem than introversion, which is correlated but not directly equivalent with being shy or socially awkward. You can be extroverted and be nervous and awkward. You can be introverted and be calm, collected and confident. It might take time, but don't ascribe that trait to your identity.\n",

It's a lot easier just to talk to girls and to force yourself to not even bring relationships to the table, because then it's just like talking to anyone else. It's easy to psyche yourself out if you create unmanageable expectations. When coronavirus is stabilized, next time you see someone interesting, just talk to them about whatever; you might not even actually like them. Ask them about something they're wearing; use your eye for detail to pick up on something most people might not. Try to figure out who this person is, don't worry so much about what they think about you. If they don't like you, they don't like you. Meh, not your problem.

By talking with that expectation and fear, you're seeing if they like you which just builds up fear of rejection. Treat every girl, regardless of how attractive they are to you, as a person who has flaws, like any person, and ask them questions to try to see if they're actually someone who you like. If you allow yourself to practice this and try it, and allow yourself to fail, I guarantee you you can see improvements.\n",

Suffer the hard work and face rejection, which is momentary and doesn't last forever, or suffer regret later on, which lingers on and on, sometimes indefinitely!\n",
